high,13396,HJ-1200 filter,Genuine and Standard,"Dedicated FPV aerial drones and other 1.4G low-pass filters. Effectively reduce 1.2G image transmission to 2.4G equipment (2.4g remote control receiver) interference and increase remote control distance!
Connected to 1.2g video transmission can greatly reduce frequency interference above 1.4g
If your image transmission is 1.2g and the remote control receiver is 2.4g, then this filter is highly recommended

Note: This filter is only suitable for image transmission at frequencies below 1.4G, not suitable for 2.4G and 5.8G image transmission!
Under the same conditions, the transmission distance and anti-blocking performance of 1.2G image transmission is much better than 2.4G and 5.8G image transmission, which is more suitable for long-distance and complex environment video transmission.
 
Features:
1: small size, light weight, small insertion loss, frequency can be customized.
2: Gold-plated SMA connectors on both sides (sma female head-external thread internal hole on one side; sma male-internal thread internal needle on the other side) , double-sided circuit board design, high mechanical strength and stable electrical performance.
3: Has better passband ripple coefficient and out-of-band suppression capability.
